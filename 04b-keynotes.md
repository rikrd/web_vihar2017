### Irene Pepperberg

#### **Interspecies communication: a means of studying the cognitive and communicative abilities of Grey parrots**

Pepperberg has been studying the cognitive and communicative abilities of Grey parrots for over 40 years. She will briefly describe the history of research on avian abilities, the training techniques that she has used to establish two-way communication with parrots, and the highlights of her work with Alex that were possible because of this communication system. She will present data on her most recent research—on topics such as probabilistic learning and Piagetian tasks— that have been carried out with her current subjects, Griffin and Athena, showing how their intelligence compares with that of human children.

#### **Towards Real-time Coordination in Human-robot Interaction**

When humans interact and collaborate with each other, they coordinate their behaviours using verbal and non-verbal signals, expressed in the face and voice. If robots of the future should be able to engage in social interaction with humans, it is essential that they can generate and understand these behaviours. In this talk, I will give an overview
of several studies that show how humans in interaction with a human-like robot make use of the same coordination signals typically found in studies on human-human interaction, and that it is possible to automatically detect and combine these cues to facilitate real-time coordination. The studies also show that humans react naturally to such signals when used by a robot, without being given any special instructions. They follow the gaze of the robot to disambiguate referring expressions, they conform when the robot selects the next speaker using gaze, and they respond naturally to subtle cues, such as gaze aversion, breathing, facial gestures and hesitation sounds.

Gabriel Skantze is an associate professor in speech technology at the
Department of Speech Music and Hearing at KTH (Royal Institute of
Technology), Stockholm, Sweden. He has a M.Sc. in cognitive science
and a Ph.D. in speech technology. His primary research interests are
in multi-modal real-time dialogue processing, speech communication,
and human-robot interaction, and is currently leading several research
projects in these areas. He is also co-founder of the company Furhat
Robotics, which develops a social robotics platform to be used in
areas such as health care, education and entertainment.

#### **Animals, humans, computers, and aliens. Is there anything in common between all their languages?**
It is often said that one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in biology is the evolution of human language. Somehow, our ancestors made a quantum leap from having no language (like all other animals), to having an infinitely complex communication medium - which no other species displays, even in part. But how can we be sure that animals have no language? What is the fundamental difference between non-human communication, and fully fledged linguistic ability? Is there some kind of "languageness" that can be quantified and measured? Some researchers claim that animal communication is nothing more than an instinctive execution of a set of neural commands. But then, at what point does autonomous computer communication become a language, rather than just a deterministic execution of commands? In the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence, this question becomes crucial - would we recognise an alien language even if we heard it? Is it possible that there are languages so alien that we could never recognise them as such? In this talk, I will explore these ideas using examples from animal communication and human language (but without examples of alien language) and show how the statistical properties of these communication systems may - or may not - help distinguish language from nonsense.

Arik Kershenbaum is the Herchel Smith research fellow in Zoology at the University of Cambridge, where he researches animal communication from both theoretical and empirical angles, combining field studies with wolves and dolphins, with computer simulations of cooperative behaviour. He received his BA in Natural Sciences from Cambridge, and PhD in behavioral ecology from the University of Haifa, before going on to be a research fellow at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis in the USA. He has also worked developing image processing and artificial intelligence systems for the Israeli aerospace industry.

### Véronique Aubergé

#### **The socio-affective glue: how to manage with the empathic illusion of human for robot?**

Is the social robot the result of the artificial intelligence production or of the natural intelligence perception of human?  One main phylogenetic feature of human is to continuously extend his body and environment competences, both cognitively and technologically. The “augmented self” paradigm has the age of human. Technologies to extend the social space of human, “to augment the others”, are very old dreams, that can be drawn by the history of speech synthesis premises. However it is only recently that the social robot becomes a societal desire, without any strong hypotheses able to explain how a smart object can become perceptively a subject. In this talk we will propose how some non verbal speech primitives, collected from human sciences explorations, can dynamically manipulate the human relation with the robot by building socio-affective glue, within ethical background challenges and risks. We will explore some ecological experimental methods implying societal people, industrial partners and researchers around the users, in order to co-construct together models, smart data and technologies in the constraints of responsible research and innovations.

Véronique Aubergé is a CNRS researcher in human sciences at the LIG Lab (Computer Sciences Lab at Grenoble, France) where she heads the Domus Living Lab platform, and she is an associate Professor at the University of Grenoble-Alpes (UGA) where she directs I3L department. She heads the Chair Robo’Ethics at Grenoble National Polytechnics Institute. She has a PhD in Language Sciences and in Computer Sciences.

At LIG Lab, she focuses on social robotics as instruments to observe and to design models on the human interactional behaviors. She develops co-construction methods for experimenting in Living Lab some real life socio-damaged situations (elderly, children at hospital), for which the robot could be a transitory aid in ethical issues. In particular she is implied in the LIG robotic Social-Touch-RobAir platform developed within the LIG fablab, and in Emox (Awabot Inc) and Diya One (Partnering Robotics Inc.) robots.
