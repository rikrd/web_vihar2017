#### Towards Real-time Coordination in Human-robot Interaction

When humans interact and collaborate with each other, they coordinate their behaviours using verbal and non-verbal signals, expressed in the face and voice. If robots of the future should be able to engage in social interaction with humans, it is essential that they can generate and understand these behaviours. In this talk, I will give an overview
of several studies that show how humans in interaction with a human-like robot make use of the same coordination signals typically found in studies on human-human interaction, and that it is possible to automatically detect and combine these cues to facilitate real-time coordination. The studies also show that humans react naturally to such signals when used by a robot, without being given any special instructions. They follow the gaze of the robot to disambiguate referring expressions, they conform when the robot selects the next speaker using gaze, and they respond naturally to subtle cues, such as gaze aversion, breathing, facial gestures and hesitation sounds.

Gabriel Skantze is an associate professor in speech technology at the
Department of Speech Music and Hearing at KTH (Royal Institute of
Technology), Stockholm, Sweden. He has a M.Sc. in cognitive science
and a Ph.D. in speech technology. His primary research interests are
in multi-modal real-time dialogue processing, speech communication,
and human-robot interaction, and is currently leading several research
projects in these areas. He is also co-founder of the company Furhat
Robotics, which develops a social robotics platform to be used in
areas such as health care, education and entertainment.
