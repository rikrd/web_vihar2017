**VIHAR-2017** is the first international workshop on **Vocal Interactivity in-and-between Humans, Animals and Robots.**  Taking place at the University of Skövde in Sweden on 25-26 August 2017, **VIHAR-2017** aims to bring together researchers studying vocalisation and speech-based interaction in-and-between humans, animals and robots from a variety of different fields.  **VIHAR-2017** will provide an opportunity to share and discuss theoretical insights, best practices, tools and methodologies, and to identify common principles underpinning vocal behaviour in a multi-disciplinary environment.


VIHAR-2017 is scheduled to take place as a satellite event immediately following [INTERSPEECH-2017](http://www.interspeech2017.org/) (which takes place in Stockholm) and it is supported by the International Speech Communication Association ([ISCA](http://www.isca-speech.org/)).  We are aiming to keep the registration fee as low as possible.

We invite original submissions of five-page INTERSPEECH-style papers or two-page extended abstracts that relate to innovative topics in any area of vocal interaction in-and-between humans, animals and robots.  Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the Scientific Review Committee.  Accepted submissions will be published in the (indexed) **VIHAR-2017** Proceedings.
